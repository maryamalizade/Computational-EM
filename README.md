# Computational-EM

Hello everyone,

Maryam is here. In here we are trying to improve our programing skills as well as our knowledge about numerical methods in Electromagnetic and Physics.
For the reference we are using newest version of Computational Electromagnetics book by Matthew N.O. Sadiku.
It's one of the most appealing book I have ever read during my master degree and now I decieded to delve deeper into it.

I hope you enjoy it and help me in this path.
Thanks in advance.
